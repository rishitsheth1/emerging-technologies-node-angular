/*Exercse 1: 
 * 
 * 1)Create an Express.jas app that allows users to create game surveys. You will have to design an 
 MVC structure. Create a model that describes a game survey object. Each survey object should have:
 
 surveyId - String
 gameGenre - String
 daysPerYear - Number
 age - String

2) Create a controller that implements: add survey, list survey, update daysPerYear or delete a survey
from the list. In development.js file, name the MongoDB database: YourFullName-survey-db.

3) Create the necessary ejs views to allow the user to use the application:
   - An ejs file will be used to add survey information (as shown above - showed a picture of 
   Labels named: Survey ID with input box, Game Genre with input box, Days played per Year with input box, age with input box, 
   and Enter survey with a button saying Add to survey)

   - An ejs file will be used to display a list of surveys as shown below (Showed something similar to our list
   page).
   - The same ejs file used for displaying the list, can be also used to either update or delete a survey
   ash shown below (In the list, there's also an update option on the same page)

4) Main page: You may use the code from Lab Assignment 2 or Sample Test to implement your  solution.
